              One of the main manuscript funds possessed by the University of
              Bologna is the one of
              <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulisse_Aldrovandi"
                >Ulisse Aldrovandi</a
              >, a famous naturalist who lived in the 16th century and who is
              considered to be the father of natural history studies. <br />
              Prof. Monica Azzolini, one of the main experts of Aldrovandi
              manuscripts at the University of Bologna, expressed the need for
              automatic transcription in order to speed up the process for the
              on-going project of <i>Edizione Nazionale Aldrovandi</i>. In
              particular, she asked for an automatic transcription of
              Aldrovandi’s own handwriting, but since there is no existing
              annotation on those documents, we opted to train two models on two
              different hands that are frequently found in the collection of
              manuscripts. <br />Aldrovandi’s manuscripts have been
              progressively uploaded on the digital library of the university
              AMS Historica using IIIF, while a census of the whole collection
              of manuscripts is available on Manus Online. In 2001, a web portal
              containing the transcription of some letters was published: here
              we can find the mere transcription in txt, but not the direct
              comparison with the original page. <br />
              Taking all these factors into account, we have decided to work on
              creating two models based on the hands of two different copyists,
              selecting those for which we had the most data available.
              Additionally, we have developed a prototype digital library using
              the "sites" feature of Transkribus.

                "Ulisse Aldrovandi proposes an iconographic project of his own
                design for his countryside villa. The manuscript is divided into
                two sections. The first, and most consistent section, deals with
                the first room of the villa, which is decorated with scenes from
                Homer’s Odyssey. The second section of the manuscript is
                dedicated to three spaces decorated with friezes containing
                emblems depicting animals and will serve as the principal focus
                of the present study. It is argued that the representations of
                these animals are closely paralleled in the watercolor plates
                that accompany Aldrovandi’s naturalistic treatises." (<a

            The dataset of images regarding Calzolari’s letters was downloaded,
            through a request to the IIIF Image API, directly from the IIIF
            manifest stored in AMS Historica, setting the image quality to
            maximum. On the other hand, we asked directly to the person in
            charge of digitization at University of Bologna for the images
            related to Manuscript 99, since it is still in the process of being
            digitized by an external company. In order to get good samples we
            did not consider pages that were slightly damaged and in which ink
            bleed was present. Moreover, we did not consider pages with complex
            layouts or in which there were lots of missing annotated words in
            the transcription. <br />In our case, the ground truth needed to
            provide input to the supervised machine learning-based model PYLaia
            HTR is represented by transcriptions done by experts in the field.
            The transcriptions used here were already available on the web; both
            of them presented expanded abbreviations even though they were
            originally abbreviated in the manuscript. <br />Considering all of
            these aspects, we defined which goals the model should achieve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>automatically recognize text and layout;</li>
            <li>
              automatically recognize abbreviations and the correspondent
              word(s).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In order to achieve an automatic recognition of text and layout, we
            relied on previously trained models:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For all the documents we used the automatic layout recognizer
              <b>“Universal Lines”</b>
              that gave us a good starting point even though it needed some
              manual corrections. In particular, we noticed that the lines were
              not correctly recognized in the “signature” part of the letters,
              and the page layout did not include page numbers or
              cross-reference marks.
            </li>

              After having prepared our documents, we trained the models using
              as a base the already existing
              <b>“Italian Administrative Hands 1550-1700”</b>
              and tuning some parameters using the additional features of
              Transkribus Expert. In particular we noticed that keeping the
              standard batch size used by Transkribus (24) was not effective at
              all, so for all the processes we chose to diminish it to 4 and saw
              a great improvement in performance. We chose to diminish the
              number of epochs to 100 because we were dealing with a smaller
              number of words and our models were already relying on a starting
              one.

            The graphs showcase the learning curves of both the training and
            validation set, which represent how much the Character Error Rate
            value is diminishing over the epochs. Generally speaking, if CER is
            over 10% the transcriptions are not so accurate because they provide
            a model that requires lots of manual corrections. For this reason, a
            trial and error approach has been fundamental to get to these
            results which are the best we could achieve given our dataset, while
            adjusting the parameter values. As it can be noticed by looking at
            the graphs, in the generated models the validation curve for CER is
            slightly higher than the other. This may indicate overfitting,
            suggesting that by reducing the batch size, the model has closely
            memorized the training data but struggles to generalize effectively
            to unseen data. In order to prevent this phenomenon from happening,
            a bigger dataset is surely needed along with tuning the correct
            parameters.

          <h5>BiancolinusHandwriting</h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first model was trained on the handwriting of Andrea Biancolino,
            one of the most prolific Aldrovandi’s copyists and one of the few
            that has signed some documents. We used as ground truth for
            annotation the Manuscript 99, composed of 90 pages, because it was
            the only one that already possessed a complete transcription. The
            manuscript is mainly written in Italian but some parts, mainly
            quotes, are written in Latin, as a consequence the model created
            ideally transcribes both languages. Moreover, thanks to Manus Online
            we discovered which other manuscripts Biancolino transcribed both in
            Italian and Latin. Having discovered this, we can now estimate that
            the model could be reused for transcribing seven more manuscripts.
            The Character Error Rate (CER) value for this model is 7.50% with a
            training set size of 9674 words.

                CER of 11.26% between the ground truth transcription and the
                predicted one by the model.

                Both from the comparison and this latest test we noticed that
                the model is not so efficient when it comes to abbreviations,
                and in particular words that are written without whitespaces
                among them. Moreover, we noticed a few minor errors that
                occurred frequently: the transformation of the first letter from
                capital letter to lowercase; missing punctuation, in particular
                stress marks and apostrophe.

          <p>
            The second model was trained on the handwriting of another anonymous
            copyist. We made this choice because we had a substantial number of
            already transcribed pages from Francesco Calzolari's letters
            available on “Teatro della Natura di Ulisse Aldrovandi” portal. The
            manuscript examined is 38/2.3 present in IIIF format on AMS
            Historica. We focused on the correspondence 26r-72v, Verona, 1554,
            containing Calzolari letters. However, since the name of the copyist
            is unknown in this case, we cannot determine to which extent this
            model can be further reused. The Character Error Rate (CER) value
            for this model is 16% with a training set size of 10565 words.

                We also used Transkribus Expert to compute the comparison
                between the two examples and the CER was 18.10%. The main errors
                appear to be similar to those of Model 1: abbreviations are not
                correctly recognized and sometimes prepositions and words that
                do not possess whitespace between them are not separated by the
                model. In general, this model can be considered as a good
                starting point for a transcription, while it needs further
                manual refinement in order to get to the complete correct
                result.

            Both models can be considered as a good starting point and can serve
            as useful tools for scholars to speed up transcription tasks. The
            next step is to use these models to create more "ground truth"
            documents, which will expand the training data and further improve
            the models. We see this work as an initial attempt to automate the
            transcription of Ulisse Aldrovandi's documents, with opportunities
            for future development.
