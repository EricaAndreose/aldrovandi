              One of the main manuscript funds possessed by the University of
              Bologna is the one of Ulisse Aldrovandi, a famous naturalist who
              lived in the 16th century and who is considered to be the father
              of natural history studies. <br />
              Prof. Monica Azzolini, one of the main experts of Aldrovandi
              manuscripts at the University of Bologna, expressed the need for
              automatic transcription in order to speed up the process for the
              on-going project of Edizione Nazionale Aldrovandi. In particular,
              she asked for an automatic transcription of Aldrovandi’s own
              handwriting, but since there is no existing annotation on those
              documents, we opted to train two models on two different hands
              that are frequently found in the collection of manuscripts.
              <br />Aldrovandi’s manuscripts have been progressively uploaded on
              the digital library of the university AMS Historica using IIIF,
              while a census of the whole collection of manuscripts is available
              on Manus Online. In 2001, a web portal containing the
              transcription of some letters was published: here we can find the
              mere transcription in txt, but not the direct comparison with the
              original page.

            All the images used for training the model have been downloaded from
            the IIIF manifest, setting the image quality to maximum. Then, we
            annotated manually the training and validation set, taking care, in
            particular, of the abbreviations used by the copyists. For all the
            documents we used the automatic layout recognizer
            <b>“Universal Lines”</b>
            that gave us a good starting point even though it needed some manual
            corrections. In particular, we noticed that the lines were not
            correctly recognized in the “signature” part of the letters, and the
            page layout did not include page numbers or cross-reference marks.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having prepared our documents, we trained the models using as
            a base the already existing
            <b>“Italian Administrative Hands 1550-1700”</b>
            and tuning some parameters using the additional features of
            Transkribus Expert. In particular we noticed that keeping the
            standard batch size used by Transkribus (24) was not effective at
            all, so for all the processes we chose to diminish it to 4 and saw a
            great improvement in performance. We chose to diminish the number of
            epochs to 100 because we were dealing with a smaller number of words
            and our models were already relying on a starting one.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it can be noticed by looking at the graphs, in the generated
            models the validation curve for CER (Character Error Rate) is
            slightly higher than the other. This may indicate overfitting,
            suggesting that by reducing the batch size, the model has closely
            memorized the training data but struggles to generalize effectively
            to unseen data. In order to prevent this phenomenon from happening,
            a bigger dataset is surely needed along with fine tuning the correct
            parameters by a trial and error approach.

          <h5>Model1</h5>
          <p>
            The first model was trained on the handwriting of Andrea Biancolino,
            one of the most prolific Aldrovandi’s copyists and one of the few
            that has signed some documents. We used as ground truth for
            annotation the Manuscript 99, because it was the only manuscript
            that already possessed a complete transcription. The ms. is mainly
            written in Italian but some parts, mainly quotes, are written in
            Latin, as a consequence the model created ideally transcribes both
            languages. Moreover, from Manus Online we discovered which other
            manuscripts Biancolino transcribed both in Italian and Latin. Having
            discovered this, we can now estimate that the model could be reused
            for transcribing seven more manuscripts

        <div class="a">
          <h5>Model2</h5>
          <p>
            The second model was trained on the handwriting of another anonymous
            copyist. We made this choice because we had a substantial number of
            already transcribed pages from Francesco Calzolari's letters
            available on “Teatro della Natura di Ulisse Aldrovandi” portal.
            However, since the name of the copyist is unknown in this case, we
            cannot determine the extent to which this model can be further
            reused.
